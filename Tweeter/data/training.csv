negative,pretentious editing ruins a potentially terrific flick .
negative,"not every animated film from disney will become a classic , but forgive me if i've come to expect more from this studio than some 79-minute after-school "" cartoon "" ."
negative,"do not , under any circumstances , consider taking a child younger than middle school age to this wallow in crude humor ."
negative,"nothing debases a concept comedy quite like the grinding of bad ideas , and showtime is crammed full of them ."
negative,much-anticipated and ultimately lackluster movie .
negative,this is really just another genre picture .
negative,"each story on its own could have been expanded and worked into a compelling single feature , but in its current incarnation , storytelling never quite gets over its rather lopsided conception ."
negative,"william shatner , as a pompous professor , is the sole bright spot . . ."
negative,a trite psychological thriller designed to keep the audience guessing and guessing -- which is not to be confused with suspecting -- until it comes time to wrap things up and send the viewers home .
negative,neither funny nor suspenseful nor particularly well-drawn .
negative,"'carente de imaginacin , mal dirigida , peor actuada y sin un pice de romance , es una verdadera prdida de tiempo y dinero'"
negative,"acting , particularly by tambor , almost makes "" never again "" worthwhile , but [writer/director] schaeffer should follow his titular advice"
negative,"both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie ."
negative,""" collateral damage "" goes by the numbers and reps decent action entertainment  until the silly showdown ending that forces the viewer to totally suspend disbelief"
negative,'enigma' is a good name for a movie this delibrately obtuse and unapproachable . a waste of good performances .
negative,"a dreary , incoherent , self-indulgent mess of a movie in which a bunch of pompous windbags drone on inanely for two hours . . . a cacophony of pretentious , meaningless prattle ."
negative,"i kept thinking over and over again , 'i should be enjoying this . ' but i wasn't ."
negative,"as conceived by mr . schaeffer , christopher and grace are little more than collections of quirky traits lifted from a screenwriter's outline and thrown at actors charged with the impossible task of making them jell ."
negative,"like so many other allegedly scary movies , it gets so tangled up in the twist that it chokes the energy right out of the very audience it seeks to frighten ."
negative,"the essential problem in orange county is that , having created an unusually vivid set of characters worthy of its strong cast , the film flounders when it comes to giving them something to do ."
negative,"just like hearst's enormous yacht , it's slow and unwieldy and takes a long time to reach its destination ."
negative,"there is not a character in the movie with a shred of plausibility , not an event that is believable , not a confrontation that is not staged , not a moment that is not false ."
negative,"where last time jokes flowed out of cho's life story , which provided an engrossing dramatic through line , here the comedian hides behind obviously constructed routines ."
negative,"why come up with something even quasi-original , when you can pillage from shirley jackson , richard matheson . . . and puke up something like rose red ?"
negative,"a broadly played , lowbrow comedy in which the cast delivers mildly amusing performances and no farm animals were injured by any of the gags ."
negative,. . . too gory to be a comedy and too silly to be an effective horror film .
negative,"lacks heart , depth and , most of all , purpose ."
negative,"though a bit of a patchwork in script and production , a glossy , rich green , environment almost makes the picture work ."
negative,"perfectly enjoyable , instantly forgettable , nothing to write home about ."
negative,"wasabi is slight fare indeed , with the entire project having the feel of something tossed off quickly ( like one of hubert's punches ) , but it should go down smoothly enough with popcorn ."
negative,somehow both wildly implausible and strangely conventional .
negative,this ill-fitting tuxedo is strictly off-the-rack .
negative,"is "" ballistic "" worth the price of admission ? absolutely not . it sucked . would i see it again ? please see previous answer ."
negative,"the premise is in extremely bad taste , and the film's supposed insights are so poorly thought-out and substance-free that even a high school senior taking his or her first psychology class could dismiss them ."
negative,"sets up a nice concept for its fiftysomething leading ladies , but fails loudly in execution ."
negative,"kidman is really the only thing that's worth watching in birthday girl , a film by the stage-trained jez butterworth ( mojo ) that serves as yet another example of the sad decline of british comedies in the post-full monty world ."
negative,imagine the james woods character from videodrome making a home movie of audrey rose and showing it to the kid from the sixth sense and you've imagined the ring .
negative,this time kaufman's imagination has failed him .
negative,an intermittently pleasing but mostly routine effort .
negative,"it becomes gimmicky instead of compelling . "" interview "" loses its overall sense of mystery and becomes a tv episode rather than a documentary that you actually buy into ."
negative,'unfaithful' cheats on itself and retreats to comfortable territory . too bad .
negative,frenetic but not really funny .
negative,"taken individually or collectively , the stories never add up to as much as they promise ."
negative,"if you're not a prepubescent girl , you'll be laughing at britney spears' movie-starring debut whenever it doesn't have you impatiently squinting at your watch ."
negative,a didactic and dull documentary glorifying software anarchy .
negative,an awful snooze .
negative,"sluggishly directed by episodic tv veteran joe zwick , it's a sitcom without the snap-crackle ."
negative,you could nap for an hour and not miss a thing .
negative,director clare kilner's debut is never as daft as it should have been .
negative,new best friend shouldn't have gone straight to video ; it should have gone straight to a mystery science theater 3000 video .
negative,wallace seems less like he's been burning to tell a war story than he's been itching to somehow tack one together
negative,the thrill is ( long ) gone .
negative,just plain silly .
negative,"began life as a computer game , then morphed into a movie -- a bad one , of course ."
negative,"part comedy , part drama , the movie winds up accomplishing neither in full , and leaves us feeling touched and amused by several moments and ideas , but nevertheless dissatisfied with the movie as a whole ."
negative,godawful boring slug of a movie .
negative,"dull , if not devoid of wit , this shaggy dog longs to frisk through the back alleys of history , but scarcely manages more than a modest , snoozy charm ."
negative,"scene-by-scene , things happen , but you'd be hard-pressed to say what or why ."
negative,". . . an unimaginative , nasty , glibly cynical piece of work ."
negative,"it is , by conventional standards , a fairly terrible movie . . . but it is also weirdly fascinating , a ready-made eurotrash cult object . it is also , at times , curiously moving ."
negative,"the tug-of-war at the core of beijing bicycle becomes weighed down with agonizing contrivances , overheated pathos and long , wistful gazes ."
negative,vile and tacky are the two best adjectives to describe ghost ship .
negative,some decent actors inflict big damage upon their reputations .
negative,"being author wells' great-grandson , you'd think filmmaker simon wells would have more reverence for the material . but this costly dud is a far cry from either the book or the beloved film ."
negative,"offensive in the way it exploits the hot-button issue of domestic abuse for cheap thrills and disgusting in the manner it repeatedly puts a small child in jeopardy , treating her as little more than a prop to be cruelly tormented ."
negative,mark me down as a non-believer in werewolf films that are not serious and rely on stupidity as a substitute for humor .
negative,"thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents"
negative,aspires for the piquant but only really achieves a sort of ridiculous sourness .
negative,"accuracy and realism are terrific , but if your film becomes boring , and your dialogue isn't smart , then you need to use more poetic license ."
negative,"for all its highfalutin title and corkscrew narrative , the movie turns out to be not much more than a shaggy human tale ."
negative,"a soggy , cliche-bound epic-horror yarn that ends up being even dumber than its title ."
negative,one groan-inducing familiarity begets another .
negative,"although based on a real-life person , john , in the movie , is a rather dull person to be stuck with for two hours ."
negative,feeble comedy .
negative,"great story , bad idea for a movie ."
negative,with spy kids 2 : the island of lost dreams writer/director/producer robert rodriguez has cobbled together a film that feels like a sugar high gone awry .
negative,"there is no entry portal in the rules of attraction , and i spent most of the movie feeling depressed by the shallow , selfish , greedy characters ."
negative,it's hard to tell with all the crashing and banging where the salesmanship ends and the movie begins .
negative,""" my god , i'm behaving like an idiot ! "" yes , you are , ben kingsley ."
negative,a dreadful live-action movie .
negative,"divertingly ridiculous , headbangingly noisy ."
negative,"an earnest racial-issues picture that might have gotten respectful critical praise in a different era -- say , the '60s ."
negative,"a hideous , confusing spectacle , one that may well put the nail in the coffin of any future rice adaptations ."
negative,all i can say is fuhgeddaboutit .
negative,"between bedroom scenes , viewers may find themselves wishing they could roll over and take a nap ."
negative,"if you collected all the moments of coherent dialogue , they still wouldn't add up to the time required to boil a four- minute egg ."
negative,"despite all the talking , by the time the bloody climax arrives we still don't feel enough of an attachment to these guys to care one way or another ."
negative,"every bit as bogus as most disney live action family movies are -- no real plot , no real conflict , no real point ."
negative,"a sensual performance from abbass buoys the flimsy story , but her inner journey is largely unexplored and we're left wondering about this exotic-looking woman whose emotional depths are only hinted at ."
negative,"never engaging , utterly predictable and completely void of anything remotely interesting or suspenseful ."
negative,"spousal abuse is a major problem in contemporary society , but the film reduces this domestic tragedy to florid melodrama ."
negative,"oedekerk wrote patch adams , for which he should not be forgiven . why he was given free reign over this project -- he wrote , directed , starred and produced -- is beyond me ."
negative,"the creaking , rusty ship makes a fine backdrop , but the ghosts' haunting is routine ."
negative,"whatever eyre's failings as a dramatist , he deserves credit for bringing audiences into this hard and bitter place ."
negative,"scotland , pa . blurs the line between black comedy and black hole ."
negative,"it tries too hard , and overreaches the logic of its own world ."
negative,"the whole damn thing is ripe for the jerry springer crowd . it's all pretty cynical and condescending , too ."
negative,i cry for i spy -- or i would if this latest and laziest imaginable of all vintage-tv spinoffs were capable of engendering an emotional response of any kind .
negative,"a boring , formulaic mix of serial killers and stalk'n'slash ."
negative,"what you would end up with if you took orwell , bradbury , kafka , george lucas and the wachowski brothers and threw them into a blender . but that's just the problem with it - the director hasn't added enough of his own ingredients ."
negative,"with recent tensions rekindled by the kathleen soliah trial and the upcoming trial of sla members emily and william harris , not to mention sept . 11 , its difficult these days to appreciate fire's bright side ."
negative,flaunts its quirky excesses like a new year's eve drunk sporting a paper party hat .
negative,"writhing under dialogue like 'you're from two different worlds' and 'tonight the maid is a lie and this , this is who you are , ' this schlock-filled fairy tale hits new depths of unoriginality and predictability ."
negative,". . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying ."
negative,is there enough material to merit a documentary on the making of wilco's last album ?
negative,faultlessly professional but finally slight .
negative,"schmaltzy and unfunny , adam sandler's cartoon about hanukkah is numbingly bad , little nicky bad , 10 worst list bad ."
negative,"it's really yet another anemic and formulaic lethal weapon-derived buddy-cop movie , trying to pass off its lack of imagination as hip knowingness ."
negative,"scotland , pa . is a strangely drab romp . some studio pizazz might have helped ."
negative,"when perry fists a bull at the moore farm , it's only a matter of time before he gets the upper hand in matters of the heart ."
negative,there's more scatological action in 8 crazy nights than a proctologist is apt to encounter in an entire career .
negative,"too loud , too long and too frantic by half , die another day suggests that the bond franchise has run into a creative wall that 007 cannot fly over , tunnel under or barrel through ."
negative,the cartoon is about as true to the spirit of the festival of lights as mr . deeds was to that of frank capra .
negative,. . . the sum of the parts equals largely a confused mediocrity .
negative,the tone shifts abruptly from tense to celebratory to soppy .
negative,"if we don't demand a standard of quality for the art that we choose , we deserve the trash that we get ."
negative,a modest and messy metaphysical thriller offering more questions than answers .
negative,julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan .
negative,morrissette's script and direction show a fair amount of intelligence and wit -- but it doesn't signify a whole lot either .
negative,there's suspension of disbelief and then there's bad screenwriting . . . this film packs a wallop of the latter .
negative,"all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters ."
negative,mocking kung fu pictures when they were a staple of exploitation theater programming was witty . mocking them now is an exercise in pointlessness .
negative,"this is a particularly toxic little bonbon , palatable to only a chosen and very jaundiced few ."
negative,"this isn't just the cliffsnotes version of nicholas nickleby , it's the cliffsnotes with pages missing ."
negative,"considering the harsh locations and demanding stunts , this must have been a difficult shoot , but the movie proves rough going for the audience as well ."
negative,better at putting you to sleep than a sound machine .
negative,"so clichd that , at one point , they literally upset an apple cart ."
negative,"it's a decent glimpse into a time period , and an outcast , that is no longer accessible , but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor ."
negative,it might be the first sci-fi comedy that could benefit from a three's company-style laugh track .
negative,"when the plot kicks in , the film loses credibility ."
negative,credibility sinks into a mire of sentiment .
negative,"the movie takes itself too seriously and , as a result , it makes for only intermittent fun ."
negative,"[davis] has a bright , chipper style that keeps things moving , while never quite managing to connect her wish-fulfilling characters to the human race ."
negative,doesn't amount to much of anything .
negative,bullock's complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film
negative,"so stupid , so ill-conceived , so badly drawn , it created whole new levels of ugly ."
negative,the truth is that the truth about charlie gets increasingly tiresome .
negative,enduring love but exhausting cinema .
negative,"some of seagal's action pictures are guilty pleasures , but this one is so formulaic that it seems to be on auto-pilot ."
negative,a ponderous meditation on love that feels significantly longer than its relatively scant 97 minutes .
negative,a long-winded and stagy session of romantic contrivances that never really gels like the shrewd feminist fairy tale it could have been .
negative,a little too pat for its own good .
negative,there are films that try the patience of even the most cinema-besotted critic -- and this was one of them .
negative,"watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms ."
negative,"well-intentioned though it may be , its soap-opera morality tales have the antiseptic , preprogrammed feel of an after-school special ."
negative,what would jesus do if he was a film director ? he'd create a movie better than this .
negative,"when a set of pre-shooting guidelines a director came up with for his actors turns out to be cleverer , better written and of considerable more interest than the finished film , that's a bad sign . a very bad sign ."
negative,"it's a deeply serious movie that cares passionately about its subject , but too often becomes ponderous in its teaching of history , or lost in the intricate connections and multiple timelines of its story ."
negative,"can't kick about the assembled talent and the russos show genuine promise as comic filmmakers . still , this thing feels flimsy and ephemeral ."
negative,diane lane shines in unfaithful . almost everything else is wan .
negative,"i'm afraid you won't get through this frankly fantastical by-the-numbers b-flick with just a suspension of disbelief . rather , you'll have to wrestle disbelief to the ground and then apply the chloroform-soaked handkerchief ."
negative,so relentlessly wholesome it made me want to swipe something .
negative,the title helpfully offers the most succinct review of it you'll read anywhere .
negative,"the makers of divine secrets of the ya-ya sisterhood should offer a free ticket ( second prize , of course , two free tickets ) to anyone who can locate a genuinely honest moment in their movie ."
negative,god help the poor woman if attal is this insecure in real life : his fictional yvan's neuroses are aggravating enough to exhaust the patience of even the most understanding spouse .
negative,let's cut to the consumer-advice bottom line : stay home .
negative,undercover brother doesn't go far enough . it's just a silly black genre spoof .
negative,the film's implicit premise is that the faith of the tonga people is in every way inferior to that of john .
negative,rates an 'e' for effort -- and a 'b' for boring .
negative,you've already seen heartbreak if you've watched the far superior nurse betty or sunset boulevard . even the unwatchable soapdish is more original .
negative,"plays like one of those conversations that comic book guy on "" the simpsons "" has ."
negative,"a journey that's too random and inconclusive to be compelling , but which hoffman's brilliance almost makes worth taking ."
negative,the movie bounces all over the map .
negative,"but buying into sham truths and routine "" indie "" filmmaking , freundlich has made just another safe movie . it's not horrible , just horribly mediocre ."
negative,"not always too whimsical for its own good ( but enough to do harm ) , this strange hybrid of crime thriller , quirky character study , third-rate romance and female empowerment fantasy never really finds the tonal or thematic glue it needs ."
negative,""" juwanna mann ? "" no thanks . wewannour money back , actually ."
negative,it's a sometimes interesting remake that doesn't compare to the brilliant original .
negative,you're too conscious of the effort it takes to be this spontaneous .
negative,. . . salaciously simplistic .
negative,"feel bad for king , who's honestly trying , and schwartzman , who's shot himself in the foot ."
negative,"some actors steal scenes . tom green just gives them a bad odor . this self-infatuated goofball is far from the only thing wrong with the clumsy comedy stealing harvard , but he's the most obvious one ."
negative,"sometimes , fond memories should stay in the past : a lesson this film teaches all too well ."
negative,the enormous comic potential of an oafish idiot impersonating an aristocrat remains sadly unrealized .
negative,shallow .
negative,begins as a promising meditation on one of america's most durable obsessions but winds up as a slender cinematic stunt .
negative,a monster combat thriller as impersonal in its relentlessness as the videogame series that inspired it .
negative,"proof that a thriller can be sleekly shot , expertly cast , paced with crisp professionalism . . . and still be a letdown if its twists and turns hold no more surprise than yesterday's weather report ."
negative,"the reason we keep seeing the same movie with roughly the same people every year is because so many of us keep going and then , out of embarrassment or stupidity , not warning anyone ."
negative,there's not much going on in this movie unless you simply decide to buy into the notion that something inexplicably strange once happened in point pleasant .
negative,"in the second half of the film , frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives nachtwey for self-analysis ."
negative,"director barry skolnick and his screenwriters glibly tick off every point of "" the longest yard "" playbook like a checklist ."
negative,"the furious coherence that [deniro] brings to this part only underscores the fuzzy sentimentality of the movie itself , which feels , as it plods toward the end , less like a movie than like the filmed reading of a script in need of polishing ."
negative,"oh , it's extreme , all right . extremely dumb . extremely confusing . extremely boring ."
negative,"we never really feel involved with the story , as all of its ideas remain just that : abstract ideas ."
negative,"for a shoot-'em-up , ballistic is oddly lifeless ."
negative,"one minute , you think you're watching a serious actioner ; the next , it's as though clips from the pink panther strikes again and/or sailor moon have been spliced in ."
negative,what happened with pluto nash ? how did it ever get made ?
negative,we may never think of band camp as a geeky or nerdy thing again .
negative,"opens as promising as any war/adventure film you'll ever see and dissolves into a routine courtroom drama , better suited for a movie titled "" glory : a soldier's story . """
negative,"the result is solemn and horrifying , yet strangely detached ."
negative,"these spiders can outrun a motorcycle and wrap a person in a sticky cocoon in seconds , but they fall short of being interesting or entertaining ."
negative,a less-than-thrilling thriller .
negative,a long slog for anyone but the most committed pokemon fan .
negative,"matthew mcconaughey tries , and fails , to control the screen with swaggering machismo and over-the-top lunacy ."
negative,"how on earth , or anywhere else , did director ron underwood manage to blow $100 million on this ?"
negative,"everyone connected to this movie seems to be part of an insider clique , which tends to breed formulaic films rather than fresh ones ."
negative,"with a story inspired by the tumultuous surroundings of los angeles , where feelings of marginalization loom for every dreamer with a burst bubble , the dogwalker has a few characters and ideas , but it never manages to put them on the same path ."
negative,"its lack of quality earns it a place alongside those other two recent dumas botch-jobs , the man in the iron mask and the musketeer ."
negative,a benign but forgettable sci-fi diversion .
negative,the plot grinds on with yawn-provoking dullness .
negative,it's never a good sign when a film's star spends the entirety of the film in a coma . it's a worse sign when you begin to envy her condition .
negative,"it doesn't help that the director and cinematographer stephen kazmierski shoot on grungy video , giving the whole thing a dirty , tasteless feel ."
negative,desperately unfunny when it tries to makes us laugh and desperately unsuspenseful when it tries to make us jump out of our seats .
negative,this film's relationship to actual tension is the same as what christmas-tree flocking in a spray can is to actual snow : a poor -- if durable -- imitation .
negative,john mctiernan's botched remake may be subtler than norman jewison's 1975 ultraviolent futuristic corporate-sports saga . it's also stupider .
negative,director dirk shafer and co-writer greg hinton ride the dubious divide where gay porn reaches for serious drama .
negative,borrows from so many literary and cinematic sources that this future world feels absolutely deja vu .
negative,"as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound ."
negative,"the acting by the over-25s lacks spark , with csokas particularly unconnected ."
negative,"though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter ."
negative,falters when it takes itself too seriously and when it depends too heavily on its otherwise talented cast to clown in situations that aren't funny .
negative,"the fight scenes are fun , but it grows tedious ."
negative,anyone who can count to five ( the film's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .
negative,all this turns out to be neither funny nor provocative - only dull .
negative,demme's loose approach kills the suspense .
negative,this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture .
negative,[plays] in broad outline as pandering middle-age buddy-comedy .
negative,"the film is itself a sort of cinematic high crime , one that brings military courtroom dramas down very , very low ."
negative,nothing more than a mediocre trifle .
